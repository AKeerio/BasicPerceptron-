and run it to classify the data of the famous Iris dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Plot the error on the dataset over training time, and experiment with different values for the learning rate.

Many more datasets are available here, if you would like to experiment more! https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
